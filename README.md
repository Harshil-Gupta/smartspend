# React App Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a new React application using Create React App.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install the latest version from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm**: Node.js installation comes with npm (Node Package Manager). You can check the version by running:
   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use Yarn, which you can install from [Yarn official website](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Setting Up the React App

1. **Create React App**: Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```

   Replace `my-app` with your desired project name. This command will create a directory called `my-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command starts the development server and opens your new React app in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- **`npm eject`**: Removes the single build dependency from your project.
